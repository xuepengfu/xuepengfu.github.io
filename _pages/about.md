Thank you for stepping by my website!

I am now a postdoc researcher at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). My research contain both wind and marine energy, employing a combination of numerical and experimental methods. Some field measurement will also be conducted.

I finished my Ph.D. at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Ocean Engineering under supervision of Prof. [Shixiao Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ROYLltsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My Ph.D. work focuses on vortex-induce vibration (VIV) of slender structures. I did both experimental and numerical studies to reveal the mechanism of VIV. I also did some researches on data-driven turbulence model and fluids-structure interaction prediction framework. My undergraduate research was conducted with Prof. [Weiping Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weiping-Huang) at Ocean University of China.
