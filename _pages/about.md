Thank you for stepping by my website!

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Ocean Engineering under supervision of Prof. [Shixiao Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ROYLltsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My Ph.D. work focuses on vortex-induce vibration (VIV) of slender structures. I did both experimental and numerical studies to reveal the mechanism of VIV. I also did some researches on data-driven turbulence model and fluids-structure interaction prediction framework. I collaborate with Prof. [Zhaolong Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WPstGOIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), Prof. [Mengmeng Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhang-Mengmeng-3), Dr. [Haojie Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Su2DFawAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Yuwang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Su2DFawAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).


My undergraduate research was conducted with Prof. [Weiping Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weiping-Huang) at Ocean University of China. We did some research on the response frequency model of tandem cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibration. I collaborated with Prof. [Min Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Min-Zhang-60), Dr. [Hong Song](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hong-Song-11) and Prof. [Shuang Chang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shuang-Chang).
